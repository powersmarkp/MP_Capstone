### Enhancement Three Narrative

**1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**

For this enhancement, I chose to use the same artifact from my first enhancement which was the Grazioso-Salvare Dashboard from CS340.


**2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**

I chose to use this artifact for my database enhancement category because I have almost no experience working with databases, and I thought that committing to a project centered around them would be a welcome challenge that would demonstrate my ability to learn more about something I know little about and still be able to deliver a working product in a timely manner. 


**3.	Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?**

I have noticed that while we progress through the weeks of this course, I have developed a better understanding of the course outcomes and which of those I have or have not met. I am attempting to meet them all, but I have gotten into the habit of thinking of the outcomes as I work and how my projects become much higher in quality when I model the key ideas of the outcomes. I still tend to go lightly on security and commenting in my code but have made efforts to improve my habits and these improvements are reflected in my programs. 


**4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**

While modifying this artifact, I learned quickly just how much I still have to learn about databases. In previous courses, including CS340 where this artifact comes from, I learned just enough about databases to connect to them and complete assignments before having to move on to the next project or course. At times, I felt like I had perhaps committed to too much work without knowing all of what I would be using. I decided to rewrite this artifact in Java and use IntelliJ Idea to make an organized user interface for my dashboard. The biggest challenge with this was learning IntelliJ Idea, Swing, phpMyAdmin, Wamp, and anything else involved in managing this new and improved dashboard. Most of Ideaâ€™s features are simple to learn but I spent days trying to get the data from my database to show up in the table on one of my forms, even with the help of online forums and video tutorials. I learned a great deal about IntelliJ Idea, and I want to use it on future projects.
