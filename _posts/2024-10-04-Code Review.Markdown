Before beginning the enhancements on past projects, I needed to do a code review of the artifacts to get an idea of what was done right and what still needed some work.

You can find the video of my code review on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHoYUg8VfsY)

Below is a journal about my code review process.

### Part 1:
**1.	What is code review?**

Code review is the systematic analysis of code that developers can perform on their own code or teams of developers can review the code of their peers. The idea is that the slow, methodical review process will highlight any errors introduced by developers during the program’s creation. 


**2.	Why is it an important practice for computer science professionals?**

It is an important practice for computer scientists because oftentimes when seeing the same lines of code repeatedly, those writing the code can develop a sort of tunnel vision where instead of looking at each line of code, they look at large sections briefly because they already know what it contains. The program might run properly, but it may also contain errors that can prove harmful later. Code review, when performed by peers, can be a great way to build team cohesion and learn about how those around you work and think.


**3.	What are some code review best practices that you read about in the resources that are crucial to include in a code review? Include when a code review should occur in the development process with a rationale as to why.**

Some code review best practices include limiting the number of lines of code you review at one time, keep a slow and steady pace that reviews the right number of lines of code per hour, and only stay focused on reviewing for an hour at a time. The suggested number of lines to review at once is 400 and when working, reviewers should only process around 500 lines in that recommended hour. It is also recommended that when errors are found, you and your team should have a system in place for how you will address and fix them. 


### Part 2:
**4.	What software have you chosen to use to record your code review?**

For this code review, I’ve chosen to use OBS Studio as it allows unlimited recording without membership and DaVinci Resolve to mix and edit the full video.


**5.	Describe your approach to creating an outline or writing a script for your code review for each of the three categories that you will be reviewing based on the rubric as well as the code review checklist.**

My approach to writing an outline or script is like writing a speech or an essay. I will start with the major topics that need to be discussed, leaving space between each of them. I will then systematically go from one major topic to the next filling in important points and details until the main idea of the entire review is covered minus the items on the code review checklist that may not apply to a particular program or enhancement I wish to make. As a final step, I will study the code review checklist so that I better understand what it is describing. This will help keep the review moving smoothly and prevent awkward pauses.
