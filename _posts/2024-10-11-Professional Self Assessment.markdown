I have always had a fascination for computers ever since I was little, so it's no surprise that I would take an interest in computer Science now that I'm older. I started teaching myself how to code but when I found out that a degree in computer science would open up a lot of employment opportunities, I enrolled at SNHU and have been amazed at not only by how much I've learned but also how much I've loved learning it all.

### A Summary of My Skills


### What My Work Says About Me
The projects that I've completed up to this point have been stepping stones in which I've learned and forgotten countless lessons. One of the greatest lessons I've learned is that it's not about what you remember because nobody can remember everything. What's most important is remembering enough, knowing where to go to fill in the gaps, and having the right tools to make it all happen. The artifact enhancements I've made in this capstone course are a demonstration of my ability to do just that and deliver a quality product that not only meets but exceeds client requirements.
