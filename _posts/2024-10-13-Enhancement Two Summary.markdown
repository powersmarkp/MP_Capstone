The second artifact I enhanced is a to-do list app that I made back in IT390: Mobile App Development. This app allows users to add, edit, and reomve items from a standard to-do list. Users can view the entire list, which is backed up on a database.  <br>

This is the first app that I've created with connectivity to a database. A to-do list app is a bit of a small thing to need a database but the idea of that project was to make an app not relient only on local storage.<br>

The enhancement category for this artifact was data structures and algorithms. I chose to upgrade the list structure that stored to-do items to a linked list. I have to admit that before I chose to complete this enhancement, I was confusing linked lists for a more complicated data structure and didn't realize that the enhancement could be made in just a matter of minutes. <br>

The enhancement may have been a bit underwhelming, but I took the opportunity to also clean up my code and make sure that the various sections of it were properly commented and that the app met common standard practices. <br>
